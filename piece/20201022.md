The highlighted sentence gives a wider application than I've considered. 

This article can be considered as a guide way application of spatial data or spatial itself usage. Spatial data is widely used in traffic field which expands to path finding, route recommendation and many other branches. So this article matches mainly.

The figure above illustrates the crossover zone of machine learning and spatial data. And it uses landscape to outline the area.  

The following job is to explore each field with the figure as a index and exert to find out a promising branch for study propellant.

Trying to follow the crowd and predict how the trend flows, this article uses convolution networks to separate the complex problem.

Expression above gives the overview of data source.

This work splits the pedestrian and vehicles. This figure illustrates the flow of a region which is affected by regions nearby and simultaneously affects other regions close to it.

> ![image-20201022143147588](F:\Learning\Github\Papers\piece\paper\res\image-20201022143147588.png)

In the statement, “![img](F:\Learning\Github\Papers\piece\paper\res\clip_image002-1603348454856.png)” means "and" not "intersection", and the whole statement expresses that in a specified time interval, newly come trajectory infers in flow while newly gone one infers outflow.

> ![image-20201016105215023](F:\Learning\Github\Papers\piece\paper\res\image-20201016105215023.png)

How can this work predict the crowd flow: it constructed a Residual Network which includes two part: the external affection and internal one. The internal affection splits into three angle by the temporal-sequence.

For what reason can the method mentioned above works: machine learning model can contract the relationship amongst time sequence  and the logic 

underneath.

On understanding the ratio, I can;t figure out the method to compare or operate two arbitrary trajectories. What method did they use to get the ratio? How did the process the trajectory? What does the ratio mean? While as aforementioned:

![image-20201023133703585](F:\Learning\Github\Papers\piece\paper\res\image-20201023133703585.png)

It's not a difficult thing to understand the sentence but closeness is a little bit abstract to be considered as density or the short distance between trajectories because of them exist in different region and they said the ratio is of regions but aiming to trajectories! It's controversial!
