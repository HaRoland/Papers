### Machine Learning Meets Big Spatial Data

This article illustrates the structure of the whole spatial data region.

The highlighted sentence gives a wider application than I've considered. 

This article can be considered as a guide way application of spatial data or spatial itself usage. Spatial data is widely used in traffic field which expands to path finding, route recommendation and many other branches. So this article matches mainly.

The figure above illustrates the crossover zone of machine learning and spatial data. And it uses landscape to outline the area.  

The following job is to explore each field with the figure as a index and exert to find out a promising branch for study propellant.

The focus of the figure is 1,2 and 3 while 0 attaches to other fields closely.
